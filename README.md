# CameraModel

A project to model the electromagnetic fields (or at least phase
information) inside a camera, constrained by physics and the (noisy)
intensity field measurements made by a CCD or equivalent device.  We
are working on data-driven and physics-driven models for astronomical
instruments where exceedingly high precision is required for
scientific programs such as the direct detection of exoplanets.
